Feature: Some fancy feature
    In order to write cool software
    I use behaviour driven development
    with the awesome radish tool

    Scenario: Test adding numbers
      Given I have the number 5
      When I add 2 to my number
      Then I expect the number to be 7

    Scenario: Test adding other numbers
      Given I have the number 10
      When I add 32 to my number
      Then I expect the number to be 42
